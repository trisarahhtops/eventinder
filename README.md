**Problem** 

Not knowing what to do and being bored by the options seen in a list as well as having a hard time selecting something with a friend
“We are standing in our Melbourne Hostel and both of us are open to everything…we do not know what to do and neither of us really want to be the one to choose”

Our app 'Eventinder', addresses the issue of individuals who have a hard time selecting activities or events to do with friends. We aim to provide them with a seamless event-finding experience through a 'Tinder-like' format of searching for events to do with friends and tackle the issue of indecisiveness. 

Quote: “We are standing in our Melbourne Hostel and both of us are open to everything…we do not know what to do and neither of us really want to be the one to choose”

**Target Audience**

Our target audience would be individuals aged 16-40 who have a hard time deciding what to do with friends. These individuals tend to be indecisive.
